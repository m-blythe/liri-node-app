#LIRI-BOT
My Node.js application for Week 10. This repository serves as an introduction to Node.js and running JavaScript in an environment other than the Browser. 

#Start Liri Bot
Since Liri Bot is a node.js app using the command line, use git bash to navigate to the 
liri-node-app directory and type "node liri" (without the quotes) then Press Enter. 

Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move your cursor up and down the list to select a function:
